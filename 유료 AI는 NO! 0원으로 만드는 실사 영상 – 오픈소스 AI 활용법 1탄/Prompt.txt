A full-body, photorealistic rendering of a female archmage floating gracefully in a pristine winter forest at dawn. The camera is positioned at a subtle low-angle perspective to highlight her commanding presence, capturing her from the polished black Mary Jane shoes and thigh-high white stockings up through the intricate layers of her ensemble to the top of her headband. Her long, ice-blue hair is rendered strand by strand, catching the soft, diffused golden-pink morning light filtering through frost-tipped pine branches. Every individual hair reflects a delicate gradient from silvery blue roots to frosty tips. Her porcelain skin exhibits natural pores, a gentle rosy flush on her cheeks, and a subtle cool sheen where the icy atmosphere touches her skin. Her eyes, a pair of crystalline gray orbs, sparkle with specular highlights as she gazes confidently forward. She wears a white winter robe with pale blue geometric embroidery on the wide sleeves, cinched at the waist by a black corset adorned with glossy leather lacing and matte metal eyelets, over a black skirt patterned with diamond motifs. In her right hand, she conjures floating translucent sapphire-blue ice shards with realistic frost texture, each shard refracting light with photoreal clarity. In her left hand, an ancient dark-purple grimoire hovers, bound in weathered leather with ornate gold filigree and a faceted blue gemstone at its center; its pages, edged in crimson, flutter in a magical breeze. Light snowflakes drift gently around her, and the shallow depth of field softly blurs the forest background, creating a crisp focus on the mage and her mystical artifacts. Lens: 85mm f/1.4, cinematic color grading emphasizing cool tones and soft highlights.
